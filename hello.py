# ------------------------------------------------------------
# üìù Project Overview:
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Hello team!
#
# I‚Äôve developed an intuitive app that demonstrates data analysis
# features using a retail store dataset.
#
# I chose this real-life scenario to simulate how a shop could 
# visualize its data trends in a meaningful way. 
#
# The goal is to help businesses understand customer behavior 
# and spending patterns so they can grow more efficiently.
#
# Initially, I tried using the YC dataset (data/yc-companies.csv)
# to showcase the same logic, but faced some issues (explained below).

# ------------------------------------------------------------
#  Bug Report ‚Äì Table Display Glitch:
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# While testing with the YC dataset, I noticed that whenever a text 
# field (e.g., company description) is too long, the table display 
# becomes misaligned or overflows.
#
# This leads to a poor layout and makes the data hard to read,also effects the query.
#
# Consider:
# - Auto-wrapping long text
# - Using tooltips for overflowing text
# - Dynamically adjusting row height

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# üóëÔ∏è Feature Request ‚Äì File Deletion Option:
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Currently, there's no option to delete files (like unused CSVs) 
# directly from the app.
#
# I found myself needing this when experimenting with multiple datasets.
